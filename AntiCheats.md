# KILLAURA DETECTION
AntiCheat has gone far from using NPCS...

## What are the Killaura detection tricks?
**Invisible players behind** - This has been a trick that was used to defeat older client's killauras.  
This has been bypassed in 95% of the clients.

**Visible players behind** - This is a trick that is also a year old, and is patched in most public clients with FOV,
although there are ways to check if a player is real without FOV...

**Players for a short time** - This is a trick to put the entity in front in front of your FOV (but not over your
cursor) for 0.2 seconds. This has never been bypassed in any public client (Hybrid should bypass it though)
but can be bypassed using a function that is originally supposed to be used for smooth animations...

**MobInFront** - This trick has never been bypassed in any public client (except for Hybrid), but is very simple 
because almost every single killaura is designed the same way. It is also possible to bypass this by 
a slient aura.

**Heuristics- Accuracy (AAC)** - This does NOT measure how accurate the player aims. If that were the case every 
single snapping killaura would have been detected. This is again exploiting how all killauras are the same.
Currently this and MobInFront are catching all the killauras.

**Consistency Checks** - These exploit how Killauras can do something a player would not be able to do 
because of human limitations. Some of these can be bypassed while still giving a player an advantage.

## Types of Hacked Clients
**Public Clients** - Clients that have been around for a looong time. Perfect to use on NCP and vanilla servers,
but their lack of bypasses to AAC means that it is not good for AAC servers.

**Old Private Clients** - Clients that are private that are from years ago. These contain powerful bypasses
like Full Block Phase, ScaffoldWalk, and teleport but are pretty much all patched.

**New Private Clients** - The best clients for AAC servers. They have the most modern bypasses and are perfect
for hacking in GommeHD.net and more. However most of them are not public/downloadable.
