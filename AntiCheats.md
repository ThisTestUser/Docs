# KILLAURA DETECTION
AntiCheat has gone far from using NPCS...

## What are the Killaura detection tricks?
Invisible players behind - This has been a trick that was used to defeat older client's killauras.  
This has been bypassed in 95% of the clients.
Almost every single client has a bypass to this (about 50%?), because this is a year old.

Visible players behind - This is a trick that is also a year old, and is patched in most public clients with FOV,
although there are ways to check if a player is real without FOV...

MobInFront - This trick has never been bypassed in any public client (except for Hybrid), but is very simple 
because almost every single killaura is designed the same way.

Heuristics- Accuracy (AAC) - This does NOT measure how accurate the player aims. If that were the case every 
single snapping killaura would have been detected. This is again exploiting how all killauras are the same.

Consistency Checks - These exploit how Killauras can do something a player would not be able to do 
because of human limitations. Some of these can be bypassed while still giving a player an advantage.

NOTE: I am not attacking clients, I am reminding people how anti-cheats exploit clients to block them,
and how easy it is to bypass anti-cheats like AAC.
