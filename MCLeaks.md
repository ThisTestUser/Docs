#MCLeaks Stuff

###MCLeaks Stealing Accounts?

**No.**

The old AltChecker definitely shared the alts, but it said in the bottom in **bold** that the alts will be shared. However, some people don't look at the text at the bottom, so that really got a lot of the people.

The new AltLoader does not steal alts, because your alt data (session id, name) is not sent to MCLeaks if the MCLeaks session is not active.

The Authenticator at https://mcleaks.net/authenticator pretty much can't steal alts at all. Even if they secretly do (which they don't), only the session id will be taken, which will **probably not work** because of Mojang's patches (nor will extracting the data work because of this patch). 

tl;dr: MCLeaks **does not** steal accounts.

###MCLeaksV2 - Is it really done?

The thing is, this MCLeaksV2 has taken months now, despite the fact that they say its done. MCLeaks is probably announcing dates early,
because they say it was "finished" on **June 26, 2016** (probably not finished) and it is now 7/30/16, and MCLeaks says it will be out in
**8/4/16**.

Here are the dates where MCLeaks talks about MCLeaksV2:

**June 14, 2016**- MCLeaks announces new features

**June 21, 2016**- MCLeaks announces "update list" (which was released on 7/30/16)

**June 26, 2016**- MCLeaks states that its done, time to test

**June 27, 2016**- MCLeaks states that it will take a while longer

**June 30, 2016**- MCLeaks states that new auth system prevents it from being released (which encouraged replys like "when is it working")

**July 5, 2016**- MCLeaks states that no alts are working.

**July 23, 2016**- MCLeaks states that alts will be back in a "few days"

**July 30, 2016**- MCLeaks states that alts will be out on 8/4/16

**July 30, 2016**- AltDispenser says a fix will be coming out on Sunday (will they make it?)

**August 4, 2016**- AltDispenser says its delayed!

**August 4, 2016**- MCLeaks states that it will be out today. Devs will be rushing to implant this into their clients.

**Moral of the story:** If it isn't finished or it probably doesn't work, don't say it is finished. Its better to state "new features coming
out!!!" the day before and surprise everyone than say its finished 2 months before it really is.
