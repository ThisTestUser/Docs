Random stuff about servers.

###Does EmpireMC Use /vanish?

You heard that it was so transparent about bans, with a * to represent Empire Staff and telling you everytime somebody joins...

But **YES**, it does use /vanish. I was griefing on one of their servers and I saw - 

chickeneer  is in vanish mode.

by my AntiVanish exploit. (chickeneer is a developer in EmpireMC) So this is a not a normal thing to use, but if you thought that they don't use it, oh **YES THEY DO**.
