Here's just a quick scribble of facts and opinions about things in hacked clients.

##Killaura vs KillauraLegit

Differences:

1. KillauraLegit prevents you from going overboard by using things like 6 block
range, 20 attack speed, and prevents criticals which make you look like a hacker.

2. KillauraLegit faces client side, preventing you from accidently hitting a block
and a player at the same time, which means that you get flagged for angle check 
which checks if you are actually looking at something before you can interact with it.

As you can see, considering that you disabled all suspicious settings and turned everything
down (e.g. not setting range to 6 blocks), KillauraLegit will be detected **no slower** 
than if you use Killaura.
