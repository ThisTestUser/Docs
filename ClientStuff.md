Here's just a quick scribble of facts and opinions about things in hacked clients.

##Killaura vs KillauraLegit (Wurst)

Differences:

1. KillauraLegit prevents you from going overboard by using things like 6 block
range, 20 attack speed, and prevents criticals which make you look like a hacker.

2. KillauraLegit faces client side, preventing you from accidently hitting a block
and a player at the same time, which means that you get flagged for angle check 
which checks if you are actually looking at something before you can interact with it.

As you can see, considering that you disabled all suspicious settings and turned everything
down (e.g. not setting range to 6 blocks), KillauraLegit will be detected **no slower** 
than if you use Killaura. 

##SafeWalk and FastPlace vs ScaffoldWalk

Truth is, if you compare the speed of this on NCP servers, ScaffoldWalk will only be **slightly** faster.

Also, using FastPlace with SafeWalk is useless, the block placing delay has already passed by the time you move one block forward.

So what's the advantage?

1. Automation - You can look at an enemy's base and its distance while placing a block under you, while with SafeWalk you have to have your head away from enemies.

2. Faster - On specific servers you can go really fast (about twice as fast) with this hack, however on NCP servers you can get stopped for FastPlace. It doesn't matter for most private clients anyways, their ScaffoldWalk can't even look at the block properly (all are copied from Saint or some other client) so there's the speed. Also that ScaffoldWalk allows you to walk at full speed while sprinting, while with SafeWalk you can't sprint (unless you also have sprinting backwards hack).
